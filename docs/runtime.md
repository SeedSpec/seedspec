# SeedSpec Runtime

The runtime is a neutral CLI and JavaScript library. It does not know about marketplace commercial editions or any coding-agent prompt format.

## Commands

```text
seedspec prompt
seedspec begin <application-path> [--json]
seedspec validate <path>
seedspec digest <path>
seedspec inspect <path>
seedspec artifacts <path> [--json]
seedspec adapters [--json]
seedspec validate-artifact <path> <artifact-id> [--json]
seedspec discover-features <application-path> --catalog <path> [--catalog <path>] [--json]
seedspec resolve <application-path> [--feature <feature-path>] [--output <path>]
seedspec init application [--output <path>]
seedspec init feature [--output <path>]
seedspec conformance [cases.yaml]
seedspec verify-lock <project-path> --package <path> [--package <path>]
```

`prompt` prints a short, agent-agnostic instruction that a package distributor or buyer can give to an implementation agent. It delegates the detailed workflow to version-compatible official tooling rather than embedding a long marketplace-maintained prompt.

`begin` is the read-only entry point for an agent that has received an application package. It validates the package, inventories configuration, decisions, components, artifacts, acceptance material, and early planning guidance, explains the optional-content trust boundary, and prints the ordered steps that precede resolution. It does not write a project, select configuration, execute package content, fetch remote artifacts, or activate an artifact workflow.

Protocol 0.1 names `configuration.example` as an example while the current resolver uses it as its merge baseline. `begin` therefore marks that configuration as review-required instead of implying that the buyer selected it. This alpha behavior remains under protocol review.

`resolve` accepts repeated `--feature` options, an application `--config`, feature overrides through `--feature-config <id>=<path>`, product-decision answers through `--decisions`, and separate `--technical-preferences`. An implementation agent should run it only after completing the configuration, decision, optional-guidance, and completion-scope review surfaced by `begin`.

Feature argument order is not semantic. `capability-graph-v1` validates the selected graph, produces deterministic provider-first order, and records capability-revision review signals. `digest` emits the same canonical package digest recorded during resolution. `verify-lock` recomputes package identities, graph order, providers, and review bindings from explicitly supplied package directories.

`artifacts` lists declarations and registered adapters without invoking them. `adapters` lists the runtime's known artifact integrations. `validate-artifact` is an explicit request to run the registered format-specific validator. The official `org.seedspec.adapter.product-spec` adapter recognizes `org.seedspec.artifact.product-spec` and invokes `@productspec/parser`; ProductSpec is an optional dependency rather than a core package requirement.

`discover-features` recursively inspects local catalog directories and reports candidates as compatible, dependent on other features, review-required, missing capabilities, incompatible, or conflicting. It never selects a feature. Remote registry search and package acquisition remain separate catalog responsibilities.

The resulting workspace is:

```text
.seedspec/
├── project.yaml
├── agent-guide.md
├── artifacts.yaml
├── artifacts/
├── implementation-notes.md
├── verification-report.md
├── resolved-spec.md
├── resolved-config.yaml
├── dependencies.lock.yaml
└── features/
```

The output is deliberately readable by both people and coding agents. The runtime supplies implementation guidance and project-memory scaffolding, but the end user directs how the implementation agent uses optional artifact workflows. SeedSpec does not choose or change application code.

For a guided non-developer lifecycle, use the reusable `skills/use-seedspec` skill. It validates and explains a package, surfaces artifact choices, discovers feature candidates, resolves the selected handoff, and prepares the user's chosen implementation environment.
